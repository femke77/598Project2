 Problems encountered and lessons learned in Project2 Musical Squares
 
 First problem arose when we decided we needed 2 light or color sensors to find the center of the annulus. I bought a cheaper version of the
 NXT light sensor after checking with LEGO engineering and finding out that it is compatible with EV3/LEJOS if you use it as a NXTColorSensor.
 When we tried to make it work, the sensor flashed a few times and said "Failure to Set Mode" on the brick screen. Various testing and debugging 
 did not achieve the results. I checked with the seller of the sensor and according to that person, the NXT is NOT compatible. 
 Later I decided to try it as a NXTLightSensor :
 
 Then I decided to try NXTColorSensor in ambient mode which i had not tried before
 
 
 The other problem came to fruition when I got a bright idea that using the old NXT sound sensor, we could make our robot start and stop to the
 music, unless he is on the black annulus and already stopped. 
 
 
 Another really frustrating thing is that the Lego EV3/NXT code is a rapidly evoloving entity and sometimes the changes are quite dramatic
 Its very easy to google for information on a problem and end up misled down a rabbit hole because it is probably old information. Its also 
 very hard to find good information on any new things going on. There's really a lot of miscommunication or failure of communication in this 
 world.
